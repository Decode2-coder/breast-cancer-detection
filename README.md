Breast Cancer Detection using Federated Learning and Blockchain
üìù Project Description
This project develops a secure, privacy-preserving AI system for breast cancer detection, utilizing federated learning across multi-modal medical datasets (histopathology, mammography, ultrasound).
The system integrates blockchain-based authentication using MetaMask and Web3.js for decentralized user management, ensuring data privacy and security.

üöÄ Features
Federated learning across separate datasets without raw data sharing

Real-time cancer prediction with confidence score visualization

Blockchain-based authentication (MetaMask wallet login)

TensorFlow (TFSMLayer) model deployed using Flask

Chart.js-based confidence visualization

Secure report download functionality

üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Jinja2 templating)

Backend: Flask, TensorFlow (Keras 3.x), Web3.py

Blockchain Integration: MetaMask, Web3.js

Database: SQLite (for prediction logs)

Other Tools: Chart.js for visualization, TFSMLayer for TensorFlow SavedModel loading
